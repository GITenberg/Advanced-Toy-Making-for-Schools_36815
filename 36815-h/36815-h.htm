<p style='text-indent: -1em;'>oys are today regarded as educational
factors in the life of boys and
girls. New toys come into demand
at frequent intervals in the growth
and mental development of the child. On account
of the unfailing interest on the part of
the pupils in toys and because of the unlimited
educational possibilities contained in toy making,
this work is rightfully taking an increasingly
important place in the manual arts
program in the schools.</p>

<p>This book is the outgrowth of toy-making
problems given to junior-high and high-school
pupils. The author claims no originality for
some of the toys. However, most of them
have been originated or improved upon in the
author's classes.</p>

<p>While it is entirely satisfactory to have any
of the toys mentioned in this book made as
individual projects, they are here offered as
suitable group projects or production projects,
and it is hoped that the suggested form of shop
organization for production work as treated in
Part I is flexible enough so that the plan can
be applied to most any shop conditions.</p>

<p>The drawings of toys in Part II will suggest
a variety of articles which may be used in
carrying out the production work.</p>

<p>Of course, the success of organizing and conducting
classes for this kind of work depends
largely upon the instructor. He must know
definitely what he is trying to get done. He
must adopt and pursue such methods of
dealing with both the members of the class and
the material as will contribute directly towards
the desired end.</p>

<p>Toy making carried on by the so-called productive
plan, if handled properly, will bring
out many of the essentials of an organization
typical of the commercial industries. Together
with its educational possibilities and its power
to attract the attention of those engaged in
this activity, toy making will rightfully take
its place alongside other important subjects
offered in a complete industrial arts course.</p>

<h2>SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS</h2>


<p>Where the work is to be done on the so-called
productive basis, it is of utmost importance
that, before starting, the classes should be so
organized as to allow the work to be carried
on in the most efficient, progressive manner.
The form of shop organization suggested in this
book is recommended. However, the instructor
may, particularly if he has had good practical
shop experience, employ other methods of
organization that are just as good and possibly
even better for his particular class and the
conditions under which he has to work.</p>

<p>It is also of great importance that the
instructor should acquaint himself with the
processes involved in the making of each toy
before allowing the class to begin it. This may
be accomplished by the making of a sample of
the contemplated project, carefully analyzing
its different parts and arranging the operations
in a logical sequence. This phase of the work
may be done during class discussions and
demonstrations at which time the different jigs
and fixtures needed for progressive production
may also be developed.</p>

<p>The different methods of coloring toys have
been suggested with the hope that the student
will gain a realization of the importance of
finishing, from both the artistic and the practical
point of view. The application of paint by
means of compressed air is the latest development
in the coloring of toys, and an equipment
in the school shop illustrating the principles of
compressed air as applied to productive finishing
of toys, is a step forward in making school
shops function as they should.</p>

<p>The working drawings in this book should
serve as suggestions. They have been so constructed
as to be free from unnecessary technicalities,
and to leave as much opportunity as
possible for the exercise and development of the
student's judgment.</p>

<p>It will be found that toy making offers itself
readily to the desired co-operation and correlation
with other departments in the school. For
instance, the art department may aid with the
designing and color scheme to be used on toys;
the general metal shop may help in the making
of necessary metal parts: the mechanical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
drawing department can co-operate in the making
of working drawings; the mathematics
department can figure the costs of production,
etc., etc.</p>

<p>It is hoped that the purpose of this book is
not merely to set forth a few plans and drawings
for the construction of toys, but to give
the work the broadest possible application;
creating a constructive influence on the minds
of the students, in which case it will also act as
a means of bringing into closer relationship their
life outside of school with the work in school.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p><b>1. Suggested Plan for Shop Organization.</b>&mdash;While
it is entirely satisfactory to have any of
the toys mentioned in this book made as
individual projects, they are here offered as
suitable group projects or production projects.
Production work may be defined as work done
by a class to turn out a number of similar projects
that have a marketable value, with the
aid of jigs, fixtures, and other means of duplication,
illustrating the industrial or practical
application to the tasks in hand, Figs. 1, 2, and
3. This does not mean, however, that the
school shops be transformed into a factory in
the full sense of the word. It should differ from
a factory in that the education of the student is
the major part of the product, while in the
factory production is the foremost aim.</p>

<p>In doing work by the productive plan two
important problems will present themselves at
the outset; first, the time element; and second,
industrial or practical application to the tasks in
hand.</p>

<p>A brief explanation of the plan of organization
in one of the author's classes will attempt to
show how nearly these problems can be solved.</p>

<p><b>2. Grouping of Students.</b>&mdash;Classes are divided
into groups of between four and six boys, with
a boy foreman appointed at the head of each
group. The foreman is held responsible for the
work turned out by his boys. He is to see that
they understand just what is to be done and
how it is to be done. All the group foremen are
directly responsible to the general foreman who
in turn is responsible to the instructor. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>general foreman is to act as an inspector of
finished work after it has received the group
foreman's O.K. He is also held responsible for
the condition of the shop during his class hour.
This includes looking after all material, the
manner in which stock is put away after class,
and adherence to all shop rules that have been
adopted to help in the efficiency of shop procedure.</p>

</div>

<p><b>3. The Time Clerk and Tool-Room Clerk.</b>&mdash;A
"<i>Time Clerk</i>" is appointed to take charge of
the time cards. He is also held responsible for
all the clerical work that is to be done in the
shop.</p>

<p>A <i>Tool-Room Clerk</i> is appointed to take charge
of the shop tool room. He is to keep check of
all tools given out and taken in. His spare
time should be devoted to the care of tools.</p>

<p>If possible, each boy in the class should be
given an opportunity to act in each capacity
that has been created, so that he may get the
most varied experience in shop procedure. This
will necessitate the changing of boys from one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
group to another; the changing of foremen,
clerks, etc., at intervals which will of course be
governed by the size of the class and the number
of hours devoted to the work.</p>

<img src="images/i_016.jpg" width="480" height="620" alt="Fig. 4. The time-card rack." title="" />
</div>

<p><b>4. Recording Attendance.</b>&mdash;Boys, upon entering
the shop, register their presence at the
Time-Card Rack, Fig. 4. This is done by
turning the time card shown in Fig. 5, so that
the back side, which has the word present
printed at top, is exposed. The time clerk then
inspects the cards and notes those that have
not been turned, and records the absences. He
then fills in the date and passes the cards out
to the boys in the shop. Toward the latter part
of the period, a few minutes time is given the
boys to fill in the necessary data on the time card.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The time cards are then collected by the time
clerk and put into a box where the time cards
of all the classes are kept. In the meantime
the time clerk puts back into the time rack
the cards of the incoming class. This duty is
performed by the time clerks of all the classes,
thereby necessitating the use of only one time
card rack.</p>

<p><b>5. Time Cards.</b>&mdash;Referring to the time card
mentioned in Fig. 5 it will be seen that the
workman's shop number is filled in at the top.
Then under the heading of "Woodworking
Department" are two horizontal rows of items
which need very little explanation. Following
are three columns headed "Operation," "Assignment,"
and "Time." Below the word
"Operation" are set down the various operations
undertaken in the woodworking department,
with several vacant spaces provided
where other and special operations can be filled
in. It will also be noticed that "Operations"
are divided into two kinds, machine work and
bench work. The instructor's glance at the time
card will tell him at once what phase of the
work the boy has been employed in and will
help him in apportioning the work so that the
boy is offered a varied experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><b>6. Using Time Card.</b>&mdash;For shops that are not
equipped with the kind of machines marked on
the illustrated card, it would be well to omit
the names of machines in the "operation"
column. The instructor may then fill in the
operation whatever it may be.</p>

<p>Under the heading "Assignment" and against
the operation which is to be undertaken by the
student, the instructor writes in the name of the
part to be made. This is the student's assignment
and it should be read by him at the time
he records his presence at the time-card rack
upon entering the shop.</p>

<p>In making assignments, the instructor may
find it rather difficult to keep up with large
classes of boys. This difficulty may be overcome
by making an assignment to an entire
group instead of to each boy. For example, in a
class of twenty-five that would probably be
divided into five groups, the instructor may
make the assignment to the foreman of each
group and each foreman in turn can inform the
boys of his group as to the nature of the assignment.
The boys can then enter the assignment
on their time cards at the end of the period
when the time spent on the job at hand is
also recorded.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 466px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 5. Time card</span>
<img src="images/i_018.jpg" width="466" height="640" alt="Fig. 5. Time card" title="" />
</div>

<p>The student's shop number, name, and grade
should be filled in by the time clerk who can
get out a number of cards for each student in
advance and these are kept ready for use by the
instructor. The instructor can then mark the
project and the job number together with the
student's assignment. At the same time he
estimates the journeyman's time and rate and
enters them in the space provided.</p>

<p>The time card in Fig. 5, is 3&frac12; inches by 9
inches, made of three-ply bristol board. All
worker's cards are printed on white colored
bristol while those of the foremen are of blue
colored bristol. This plan is for the instructor's
convenience to be able to pick out the foremen's
time cards at a glance.</p>

<p>In the triple column under the heading
"TIME" is provided room for the date and
spaces in which the student can write the time
in minutes spent on the various operations on
that date. The triple columns on each side of
the card allow of the cards being used for six
days. If a job lasts longer than six days another
card should be used marking them No. 1 and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
No. 2, respectively, in the space marked "Card
No." Both cards should be fastened and kept
together.</p>

<p>Effort should always be made to have all the
assignments short (less than six days) so that
the student's record may be computed at the
end of each week by the time clerk.</p>

<p><b>7. Grading Students.</b>&mdash;The next four spaces
contain in condensed form, the information
itemized in other parts of the card. This,
together with other information set down by
the instructor, is the vital material sought for.</p>

<p>The item A "Journeyman's Time" is very
easily recorded by the instructor. It is arrived
at in the same way as in making out the estimate
for any piece of work and can be recorded almost
at once. The main purpose here is to set for
the student a standard of time on which to
work.</p>

<p>The item B is the rate in points per hour,
based on the journeyman's time.</p>

<p>The item C is the total of the student's time
added together from the various spaces under
"Time."</p>

<p>Item D "Quality Decimal" is the quality of
the student's job expressed in the form of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
decimal, with 100% as the maximum. This
mark should be filled in by the instructor when
the student completes his job.</p>

<p>The next item, the number of points the
student earns is found by the formula Points
= (A&times;B)D</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td valign='top'>Points earned per hour =</td><td align='center'><span class="u">(A&times;B)D</span><br />C</td></tr>
</table>


<div class="figright" style="width: 453px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 6. Monthly accomplishment sheet</span>
<img src="images/i_019.jpg" width="453" height="640" alt="Fig. 6. Monthly accomplishment sheet" title="" />
</div>

<p>For example, a student receives an assignment
to cut to thickness, width, and length,
sixty chair legs. The size of the legs he is to
get from the job blueprint. He spends 60
minutes a day, for three days, making a total
of 180 minutes or 3 hours. The time it would
take a journeyman to do the same job is
estimated at 2 hours. The rate adopted is at
80 points per hour; the journeyman therefore
earns A&times;B = 2&times;80 = 160 Points. The quality of
the student's job is graded by the instructor as
75%. The number of points the student earns
is found by the formula Points = (A&times;B)D =
(2&times;80).75 = 120 Points. To find the number of
points the student earns per hour, divide 120
points by the number of hours it took the
student to complete the job, which equals
120 &divide; 3 = 40, the number of points the student
earns per hour. However, if the student
would be graded 100%, he would earn the
same number of points as the journeyman.
But of course, he would have done it in
three hours where the journeyman has earned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
the same number of points in two hours. It will
readily be seen that this scheme offers the
student an everlasting incentive to equal the
journeyman's record.</p>

<p>Having obtained the points on the time card
or assignment card as it may be called, these
are then transferred to a monthly accomplishment
sheet as shown in Fig. 6, which is provided
for all the students in all classes.</p>

<p>The total number of points for each boy,
group, and class can then be easily obtained.
These totals can be put up in poster form
and hung on the shop's bulletin board, showing
the standing of each boy, group, and class.
It is surprising the amount of interest and competition
that can be aroused; everyone working
for the highest honors, unconsciously, with a
competitive spirit that will bring out considerable
thought and effort to the matter of handling
material for maximum production.</p>

<p><b>8. Preliminary Discussion and Preparation for
Shopwork.</b>&mdash;Of course, no time card or assignment-record
scheme can hope entirely to eliminate
the necessary preliminary discussions and
preparation. The author has found it of
material help to meet the foremen of all the
classes at hours other than their regular class
hour and discuss such topics as "Securing
Cooperation," "Instructing Workers," "Maintaining
Cleanliness and Order," "Records and
Reports," "Inspecting Work," "Routing Material
Thru Shop," "Care of Stock," etc.</p>

<p>Details regarding construction and assembling
should be worked out by the instructor
beforehand, and also developed with the class
as the work progresses. Care should be taken
that plans are carefully made regarding the
storage of stock and unfinished parts.</p>

<p>The old saying, "An ounce of prevention is
worth a pound of cure," is an old one, but a
good one.</p>

<p><b>9. Bazaars, Toy Sales, Etc.</b>&mdash;The plan of selling
toys, that are made in the school shop, to
the boys and girls of the school is a plausible
one. It can very easily be accomplished in the
form of bazaars, exhibitions, or school toy sales.</p>

<p>The writer has had a number of samples of
different toys made and put on exhibition,
and orders taken, requiring a deposit on each
order. These were then turned in to the shop
department and the toys made on the productive
plan.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys in the shop would receive school
checks, Fig. 7, for the total number of points that
they earned for the semester. These checks
could then be used by them towards the purchasing
of any of the toys that were put on
sale; a certain number of points required for the
purchase of different toys.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">

<img src="images/i_021.jpg" width="1024" height="439" alt="Fig. 7. Credit check, based on number of points carved" title="" />
</div>

<p>This plan was made possible by adding on to
the number of orders received an additional
number equal to the number of boys in the
shop. For example, twenty-four orders for
toy milk wagons were received by a class of
twenty-four boys. Then instead of making
twenty-four toy milk wagons we doubled the
number and made forty-eight of them. The
price that was figured on for the twenty-four
orders would more than cover the cost of material
for the other twenty-four articles that
the boys would be able to buy with their
earned checks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2><span class="smcap">Coloring Toys</span></h2>


<p><b>10. Sanitation Emphasized.</b>&mdash;All application of
color to toys should carry with it a realization
that toys are meant primarily for children and
that all paints should therefore be free from
poisonous compounds.</p>

<p>All paints used should be of good quality so
that it will not come off easily to discolor the
hands or tongues of children who cannot resist
the temptation of sticking everything possible
into their mouths.</p>

<p><b>11. Preparation of Surfaces.</b>&mdash;Wooden toys
may be finished quite bright and in various
colors.</p>

<p>Before applying the color it is absolutely
necessary that every part of the toy has been
thoroly sanded. Where sanding is done by
machine, care should be taken not to sand the
wood too much. Many difficulties may arise
from too much as well as from too little sanding.
In hand sanding, the use of a block 2&frac12;" &times; 3&frac12;",
to which is glued a piece of cork, is recommended.</p>

<p><b>12. Application of Water Colors.</b>&mdash;Toys may be
colored by the use of different materials and by
various methods. Kalsomine colors, opaque
water colors, variously known as show card
colors, liquid tempera, and letterine,&mdash;all come
under the heading of water colors. All but the
kalsomine may be obtained in small jars and
ready for use. Kalsomine colors come in powder
form in various colors and may easily be prepared
by mixing with water and a little glue to
bind the parts together. They are much
cheaper than the ordinary forms of transparent
and opaque water colors. They may be applied
with the ordinary water color brushes.</p>

<p>After a coat of water color has been applied
to the toy, it may be necessary to remove the
rough parts with very fine sand paper. Care
should be taken not to "cut thru" when sanding.</p>

<p>To preserve and protect the water color on
the toy a coat of white shellac may be applied.
If a more durable finish is desired a coat of
good clear varnish over the shellac will serve the
purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p><b>13. Analine Water Stains.</b>&mdash;For general finishing
of toys analine water stains will produce
excellent results. They are known for their
ability to penetrate the wood deeply and the
ease with which any shade can be produced.
Water stain raises the grain of the wood more
than any other. This makes it necessary to
sandpaper down the raised grain until smooth
and then proceed with the shellacking and
varnishing until the desired results are obtained.</p>

<p>In preparing analine water stains, only analines
that are soluble in water are used. Place
an ounce of the analine to a quart of hot or
boiling water, pouring the water over the dye-stuff
and stirring meanwhile with a wooden
paddle or stick. Soft water is the best. In
about an hour the dye may be filtered thru a
piece of fine woven cloth. As metal is apt to
discolor the dye, it is better to use a glass container.
If the prepared solution is too strong
it may be diluted in more water. Use hot
water for diluting the stain.</p>

<p>The work with water stain must be done
quickly in order to obtain a uniform coloring
on the surface. Water stains are used a great
deal where the dipping process is employed in
the finishing of toys. A hot dipping stain is
preferable to a cold dipping stain, first, because
it penetrates more readily and second, because
it dries quicker.</p>

<p><b>14. Formulas for Analine Water Stains.</b>&mdash;(Stock
Solutions).</p>

<p><i>Red</i>: Rose benzol five parts, water ten parts.</p>

<p><i>Rose Red</i>: Dissolve 3 oz. Rose Bengal in 5
pints of water.</p>

<p><i>Blue</i>: (a) Dissolve 1 oz. of the best indigo
carmine in 8 oz. of water. (b) Prussian blue
dissolved in water.</p>

<p><i>Dark Blue</i>: Dissolve 3 oz. Bengal blue in 3&frac12;
pints of boiling water, and stir and filter the
fluid in ten minutes time.</p>

<p><i>Green</i>: Mix Prussian blue and raw sienna in
such proportions as will give the desired color.
Mix in water.</p>

<p><i>Brown</i>: Dissolve 3 oz. of Bismark brown in
&frac12; gal. of water.</p>

<p><i>Yellow</i>: Auramine 4 parts, sulphate of soda
10 parts, mixed in water.</p>

<p><i>Black</i>: Nigrosine black, four ounces, dissolved
in one gallon of boiling water.</p>

<p>When wanted for use, these analines may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
diluted with water. The rule is, an ounce of
analine to the gallon of water to form a working
stain. Or to a pint of the stock solution, as
it is called, you may add three pints of water.</p>

<p><b>15. Oil Stains.</b>&mdash;It will be found that quicker
work can be done with oil stain than with water
colors. For that reason, oil stains are also
used a great deal as a dipping stain. In preparing
oil stains, the best mineral or earth pigments
to dissolve with turpentine are Van Dyke
brown, chrome green, burnt and raw sienna, and
lamp black.</p>

<p><b>16. Shellacking.</b>&mdash;There are two kinds of shellac,
orange and white. The white shellac is
orange shellac that has been bleached. The
purpose of shellac as commonly understood is
to give a quick coat over the stain. The thin
coat formed serves as a protector for the stain
and also as an undercoater for the following coat
of varnish. In this way at least one coat of
varnish is eliminated and a great deal of time
saved because the shellac dries within a few
minutes. To thin shellac use denatured alcohol.</p>

<p>On cheaper toys a coat of shellac only may be
used as a covering for the color stain. If orange
shellac is used it will be found that it effects
the color of the stain used. White shellac also
produces a slight change in color and for this
reason many working with toys will use a good
clear varnish instead.</p>

<p><b>17. Varnishing.</b>&mdash;Two or three coats of varnish
will produce a very durable finish. The first
coat of varnish ought not be quite as heavy as
the succeeding coats. If the varnish is of extra
heavy body it should be reduced slightly for the
first coat. The best varnish reducer is thin
varnish. To prepare this reducer, take one part
varnish (the same varnish to be reduced), and
two parts of turpentine. Shake these together
well and let stand twenty-four hours before
using. This will reduce the consistency of the
varnish without tearing down the body as pure
turpentine would. The first coat of varnish
should be allowed to dry thoroly before the
second coat is applied.</p>

<p>Oil varnishes made from good hard gums,
pure linseed oil, and turpentine, are the most
valuable. In using turpentine to thin varnish
care should be taken that adulterated turpentine
is not used. To play the game safe it is
advisable to use a little benzine, for it will not
injure the varnish, but will evaporate entirely,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
and not flatten the varnish as turpentine does.</p>

<p><b>18. Points on Varnishing.</b>&mdash;(1) The less varnish
is worked under the brush the better its
luster. (2) Use clean brush and pot, and clean
varnish. See that the surface is clean before
beginning to varnish. (3) Allow a coat of
varnish plenty of time for drying until it becomes
hard.</p>

<p><b>19. Colored Varnish.</b>&mdash;Colored varnish is that
in which a proportion of varnish is added to the
pigment and thinned. The base is usually an
earth color such as ochre, sienna, venitian red,
Van Dyke brown, umber, lamp black, etc.</p>

<p>With this the work can be done in one coat.
This method of finishing is usually employed
on the cheaper class of toys where it isn't
advisable to apply an expensive finish.</p>

<p><b>20. Another Suggestion for Finishing.</b>&mdash;Tint a
gallon of benzine or gasoline with chrome green,
chrome yellow, and vermilion, ground in Japan
until the desired shade is obtained. This
formulae is especially good for dipping purposes.</p>

<p><b>21. Use of Paint.</b>&mdash;Although paint can be
bought ready prepared and in any color, as has
been stated, it is advisable to have the students
mix their own colors and choose their own color
scheme.</p>

<p><b>22. Ingredients of good Paint.</b>&mdash;The best
paints are usually made by mixing together
white lead, linseed oil, pigment of the desired
color (colors ground in oil), and a drier.</p>

<p>While white lead is sufficient as the pigment
for white paint, a better result is obtained by
mixing zinc oxide with the white lead. These
two substances have the convenient property
of balancing each other's disadvantages. For
instance, zinc oxide has a tendency to crack and
to peal, which is overcome by the tougher
coating formed by the white lead. Again, when
white lead is exposed to light and weathering, it
becomes chalky, which fault is remedied by the
property possessed by zinc oxide, of remaining
hard.</p>

<p>The linseed oil used is obtained from flaxseed
by pressing the thoroly ground seed. About
twenty-three gallons of oil can be obtained from
one bushel of the seed. By boiling the oil with
lead oxide or manganese oxide it can take more
oxygen from the air, and thereby its drying
powers are increased.</p>

<p>Driers are substances that absorb oxygen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from the air and give part of it to the oil. The
raw linseed oil absorbs the oxygen from the air
very slowly, but the addition of turpentine is a
great aid in overcoming this defect.</p>

<p>To insure the best results in painting, one
must first consider the kind and condition of the
surface to be painted, and to what use the toy
will be put; then decide on the proper composition
and consistency of the paint.</p>

<p><b>23. Application of Paint.</b>&mdash;In applying the
paint to the toy the first coat should be thinned.
This will act as a primer or undercoat for the
succeeding coats of paint. Care should be taken
that plenty of time is allowed between coats
for the paint to dry thoroly. Three coats of
paint will produce a good finish.</p>

<p><b>24. Preparation of surface.</b>&mdash;All woodwork
must be sanded and thoroly dry before any
paint is applied. Care should be taken to see
that all knots and sappy streaks shall be covered
with a coat of orange shellac. Then apply the
first coat.</p>

<p>After the priming coat of paint is thoroly
dry, putty up all knot holes, dents, cracks, and
other defects in the surface with a pure linseed
oil putty composed of equal parts of white lead
and whiting. When putty is dry, proceed with
the other coats.</p>

<p><b>25. Tinting Materials.</b>&mdash;Formulas for making
tints are to be followed only in a general way.
Make some allowance for slight variations in
the strength and tone of different makes of
colors. Chromes and ochres vary noticeably.
Weigh out your color and add it gradually, not
all at once, noting the effect as you go. When
you reach the desired shade, stop, regardless of
what the formula calls for. Turpentine and dark
driers will slightly alter shades. Make allowance
for this.</p>

<p><b>26. Mixing Paints.</b>&mdash;Faulty mixing, even with
the best of materials, is not likely to make durable
paint. The important thing is to give the
lead and oil a chance to incorporate themselves
in that close union which they always make if
allowed to do so. The following directions give
best results. The order is important.</p>

<p>(1) Break up the white lead with a paddle,
using only enough oil to bring it to the consistency
of colors in oil.</p>

<p>(2) Add your colors for tinting. Coloring
matter added after the paint has been thinned is
likely to break up in lumps which leave streaks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
when brushed out.</p>

<p>(3) Put in drier.</p>

<p>(4) Add remainder of oil, stirring well.</p>

<p>(5) Last of all, put in turpentine.</p>

<p>Thinners help only the flow of the paint
never the quality.</p>

<p>To strain paint thru cheese cloth before
using will be a safeguard against lumpy colors
and streakiness. Paint also spreads further if
strained.</p>

<p><b>27. Paint Formulas.</b>&mdash;As most toys are exposed
to the weather a great deal, the following
formulas are recommended. These take no
account of tinting materials.</p>

<p>(a) Priming Coat:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
25 pounds pure white lead<br />
1 gallon pure raw linseed oil<br />
&frac12; gallon pure turpentine<br />
&frac14; pint drier, free from rosin<br />
</p></div>

<p>(b) Body Coat:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
25 pounds pure white lead<br />
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> gallon pure raw linseed oil<br />
<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>8</sub> gallon pure turpentine<br />
&frac14; pint drier, free from rosin<br />
</p></div>

<p>(c) Finishing Coat:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>
25 pounds pure white lead<br />
1 gallon pure raw linseed oil<br />
&frac14; pint pure turpentine<br />
&frac14; pint drier.<br />
</p></div>

<p>One must exercise his own discretion in using
a larger or smaller quantity of oil according to
whether the wood is oil absorbing, as white
pine, poplar, and basswood, or less permeable,
as yellow pine, cypress, spruce, and hemlock.</p>

<p><b>28. Formulas for Making Tinted Paint.</b>&mdash;Any
color or tint may be obtained by varying
the addition of tinting colors. These tinting
colors are called "colors in oil." The colors
should be added to the white lead before the
paint is thinned.</p>

<p>To twenty-five pounds of white lead ground
in oil add colors in oil as follows:</p>

<p>Where tinting colors are used in sufficiently
large quantities to alter the consistency of the
paint, add one-half as much linseed oil and
turpentine, by weight, as you add tinting
material.</p>

<p><b>29. Enameling.</b>&mdash;When using enamel as a
finish for toys, care should be taken that the
surface of the toy is in proper condition. To
obtain good results proceed as follows: Give the
wood a coat of shellac. Sand lightly and dust.
The following coat should consist of part of
white paint and one part of the enamel to be
used. This coat should be slightly tinted with
the finishing color, if the finishing coat is not
white. Allow twenty-four hours for drying
thoroly; then sand with No. OO sand paper.
Next apply a coat of enamel of the color desired
for the finished work. (Enamels may be tinted
with colors ground in oil.)</p>

<p>Should the enamel not work freely, add a
spoonful of benzine to a gallon of enamel. Turpentine
may also be used as a thinner for
enamel.</p>

<p>A better finish of enamel consists of two coats
of paint before applying the enamel. This gives
it a stronger body and of course makes it more
durable.</p>

<p>Because of its durability and for sanitary
reasons enamel is the most desirable finish for
toys. Its glossy finish is attractive and very
appealing to children.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p><b>30. The Dipping Method.</b>&mdash;When a considerable
quantity of toys is to be finished, the problem
to be faced will be the cost of application of
the paint rather than the cost of the paint
itself. The dipping process, (immersing the
material to be covered) is found to be the most
successful, especially in toy making, where so
many small parts are used.</p>

<p>Many of the small pieces made can be subjected
to the dipping process at quite a saving
of time and labor, with probably better results
than where the application of paint or stain is
done with a brush.</p>

<p>The success of the dipping process depends on
the arrangement adopted for holding the toys
while the actual dipping is done and while they
are drying. Here the exercise of a little ingenuity
on the part of the students and teacher, will
overcome most difficulties.</p>

<p>Supposing that a number of checkers, or
handles, or small wheels are to be stained. A
dipping frame as shown in Fig. 8 could very
easily be prepared. You will notice the screen
tray (which is removable), and the tin sheet
which slopes towards the container. The small
pieces to be stained can be handled in wire baskets
with mesh just small enough so that the
pieces will not fall thru.</p>

<p>The wire basket is then immersed in the container
and worked up and down, so that the
liquid will penetrate and touch all pieces. It
is then pulled up and swung over the screen
tray, where the contents of the wire basket is
dumped. Here, the superfluous paint will drip
off on the tin sheet, which, because of its slope,
will cause the superfluous paint to flow back
in to the container. Fig. 9 shows the dipping
frame in use.</p>

<p>The screen tray can be removed and placed in
a rack to allow for further drying. Several
trays could then be made and a rack to hold them
could very easily be constructed.</p>

<p>The paint used for dipping purposes must so
be prepared that too much does not run off or
too much stay on, for this is surely one way to
spoil the work. It should be thinned to the
right consistency and care should be taken that
the thinners used are of the best quality.</p>

<p>Where larger pieces of work are to be dipped,
wire attachments could be devised and each
part hung separately over the dipping frame
until ready to be placed in a rack. If the wire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
attachment forms a hook on one end, it will be
possible to hang up the toy until drained and
dried. In removing the toy from the paint it
should be drawn out very slowly so that the
surface of the paint may be left as smooth as
possible.</p>

<p>Where one desires line effects on toys, these
may be lined in afterwards with a small size
striping brush or sign painter's pencil.</p>

<p><b>31. Polishing by Tumbling.</b>&mdash;-Excellent results
in polishing large quantities of small pieces,
may be obtained by tumbling. The material
to be polished should be thoroly dry. The
parts are then placed in a tumbler as shown in
Fig. 10. Cut up paraffine wax into small pieces,
using about one-fourth pound to each tumbler
full of toys. Allow these to tumble several
hours. This will distribute the wax evenly over
the parts and produce a polished surface.</p>

<p>The tumbler as shown in Fig. 10 is turned by
hand, altho it could very easily be placed in a
lathe, where one is available.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 981px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 10. Tumbler for polishing small pieces</span>
<img src="images/i_033.jpg" width="981" height="768" alt="Fig. 10. Tumbler for polishing small pieces" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>32. Care of Brushes.</b>&mdash;A suitable place should
be provided for brushes that are not in use. A
tin-lined keeper is recommended. Brushes
should be suspended so that their bristles will
not touch the bottom of the keeper, and have the
liquid in which they are kept come well up over
the bristles, so that none of the paint or varnish
may dry in the butt of the brush.</p>

<p><b>33. Paint Application by Means of Compressed
Air.</b>&mdash;In recent years, great advancement has
been made in the application of paint by means
of compressed air. The early use of pneumatic
painting equipment was confined almost exclusively
to the application of finishing materials
such as japans, enamels, lacquers, varnishes,
etc., on manufactured products. But in the
past few years improvements have been made
which eliminate all of the difficulties originally
experienced and make possible the use of this
method for interior and exterior painting, such
as buildings, ships, etc.; and at present, a large
portion of factory maintenance work is done in
this manner. Excessive fumes have been
eliminated and all materials can be applied
without removing the volatile thinners, solvents,
binders, etc., thru air reduction. This is
brought about thru the use of low pressure and
the perfection of ingenious patent nozzles and
other improvements.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p><b>34. Uses of Pneumatic Sprayers.</b>&mdash;Pneumatic
paint sprayers, or air brushes, are extensively
used in the manufacture of toys, furniture,
automobile bodies, sewing machines, telephones,
electrical equipment; in fact, very nearly all
manufactured products, as well as on ships,
structural steel and iron work, bridges and
buildings.</p>

<p>The speed of the air brush is very great compared
with hand-brush work. Usually, an air-brush
operator will accomplish as much in one
hour as a hand or bristle-brush worker will in
one day; and it is possible to obtain an even
coating, free from sags, runs or brush-marks
and better results are obtained than with the
hand brush method. A film of paint can be
applied in one operation equal to two hand-brush
coats, as it is not necessary to reduce
paints by thinning as much for air brush application,
in a great many instances, as is the usual
practice for hand-brushing. The air sprayer
can also reach places inaccessible to the hand
brush, and a perfect coat can be applied over
rough, uneven surfaces, which could not be
obtained by hand-brushing.</p>

<p>In considering pneumatic painting equipment,
the most important thing to be kept in mind is
the proper application of materials. This can
be successfully accomplished only thru the use
of compressed air at low pressures. By this is
meant using only sufficient main-line air to lay
the paint, enamel, varnish or whatever finish
may be used, on the object. Excessive pressure
results in fumes, waste of material and air reduction
taking place. By air reduction is meant
the removal of the more volatile solvents, thinners,
binders, etc., thru evaporation, and the
material thus loses its adherent and coherent
properties.</p>

<p>Both types of air-brush equipment illustrated
here require three cubic feet of air per minute
to operate and the pressure necessary depends
on the density, consistency or viscosity of the
material used. For example, undercoaters,
japans, etc.; require from twelve to fifteen
pounds of pressure to apply perfectly; while
enamels and varnishes take from eighteen to
twenty-five pounds. Water stains require about
five pounds of pressure.</p>

<p><b>35. Construction of Pneumatic Painting Outfit.</b>&mdash;A
pneumatic painting outfit for finishing work
consists essentially of an air brush, either of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
attached-container type or the gun-type with
separate paint tank, and a small compressor of
sufficient capacity to operate the air brush,
which can be belt-driven from shafting or direct
connected. An exhaust hood with fan, for the
removal of fumes, is advisable where the operation
is reasonably continuous and especially
where lacquers are used. The paint, ready for
application, is poured into the tank; and the
compressed air line leads to the tank with a
branch line for air and paint from the tank to
the nozzle of the gun type of machine; while only
the air line is required with the attached-container
type.</p>

<p>The air hose used is 5/16" in diameter while
the paint or fluid hose is the same size. The
paint hose is made of a special compound to
resist the action of the thinners, solvents, etc.,
used in the paint; and it is important to have
this correct, so that the lining will not disintegrate
and clog the air brush or gun.</p>

<p>Fig. 11 shows a five-gallon container type.
It will be noticed that the fluid connection is
nearest the nozzle and that the air connection is
at the bottom of the grip.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 1024px;">
<span class="caption">Fig. 11. A five-gallon air brush outfit</span>
<img src="images/i_036.jpg" width="1024" height="743" alt="Fig. 11. A five-gallon air brush outfit" title="" />
</div>

<p><b>36. Special Attachments for Different Surfaces.</b>&mdash;A
cone nozzle is furnished for painting irregular
surfaces and a fan nozzle for wide, flat work.
Adjusting and locking the nozzle regulates the
degree of atomization. The jets of the fan
nozzle are depressed to prevent being knocked
out of alignment. Final regulation of the flow
of material is made on the back of the gun,
independent of the pressure on the material container.
A wide variety of adjustment is possible
with this positive regulation.</p>

<p>The first pull on the trigger gives air only,
which can be used for dusting ahead of the
work; and as the trigger is released, the air
valve closes last, which prevents clogging and
dripping. When adjustments have been made
the trigger action is the only moving part of
the machine. Figs. 12 and 13 show the five-gallon
container type in actual use.</p>

</div>

<p><b>37. Cleaning Pneumatic Machines.</b>&mdash;It is not
necessary to take the gun apart nor disconnect
the hose to clean the machine. Thinner can
be run thru the device without loss by placing
a small can of reducer of the last material used
in the machine, and forcing it thru in the usual
manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><b>38. Directions for Cleaning Machine.</b>&mdash;Close
right-hand Air Valve and open release valve.
Unscrew air nozzle a few turns. Obstruct outlet
with thumb and pull trigger. Spraying pressure
is thus forced thru gun and fluid hose and
the material backed into the container. It is
advisable frequently to run thinner thru the
machine as follows: (1) Place small can of thin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>ner
in center of container directly beneath fluid
tube. (2) Replace cover and tighten wing-nuts.
(3) Close left-hand air valve and open right-hand
air valve. Pressure on container will
force thinner thru the machine and clean
perfectly without loss. Do not use spraying
pressure in cleaning. The thinner can be used
again for either cleaning or thinning purposes.</p>

</div>

<p><b>39. Directions for Operating Pneumatic Equipment.</b>&mdash;</p>

<p>1. Attach main-line air hose to air filter.</p>

<p>2. Attach fluid hose to connection marked
"Fluid" on tank and to the front connection
near air nozzle on hand-piece.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Attach air hose to connection marked
"Air" on cover and to the handle connection on
hand-piece.</p>

<p>4. Thoroly mix and strain material so that
it is entirely free from skins, lumps, and foreign
materials.</p>

<p>5. Tighten wing-nuts until paint container
is air-tight.</p>

<p>6. See that release valve is closed. Then
open right-hand air valve, turn fluid-pressure
regulator until gage shows 5 lbs. pressure in
container. Pull trigger and use fluid regulator<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
on gun to control the flow. If material is heavy,
increase pressure in container.</p>

<p>7. Open left-hand air valve and turn spraying
pressure regulator until sufficient pressure
(5 lbs. to 25 lbs.), is obtained to lay the material
on.</p>

<p>8. Make final adjustment of the flow of
material with fluid regulator on back of hand-piece
and get proper spray by adjusting the air
nozzle.</p>

<p>9. Spraying pressure and pressure in the
container depends upon the density of the
material used and the size of the surface to be
coated. A little experimenting on the part of
the operator will determine the best pressure to
use. When the fan nozzle is used, 3 to 5 lbs.
more pressure should be applied to the material
container and from 5 to 8 lbs. more atomizing
or spraying pressure used.</p>

<p>Fig. 14 shows a complete attached container
which operates on identically the same principles
as the type shown in Fig. 11. It consists
of a 1&frac12; pint container, reducing outfit, compressor,
and air tank. The 1&frac12; pint container
as shown in Fig. 15 is supplied complete with
two fluid tips, gasket, agitator tube, cup-holder,
hose union, and six feet of air hose.</p>

<p>The reducing outfit in Fig. 16 consists of a
regulative valve, an air gage, and an air filter,
complete with connections and fittings. This
outfit is for the purpose of maintaining an even
low spraying pressure.</p>

<p>Regulated pressure is applied to the air-tight
material container, raising the coating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
material to the nozzle where only sufficient
main-line pressure is used to lay the coating on.
The spraying pressure necessarily depends on
the density, consistency and viscosity of the
material used.</p>

<p>For fine finishing work, where the quantity of
materials used each day is not great, or where
the colors are changed frequently, the attached
container type is recommended.</p>

<p><b>40. Preparing Colors.</b>&mdash;The three primary colors
are red, blue and yellow. With the three
primary colors at hand, almost every variety of
color desirable for ordinary use can be easily
prepared. Fig. 17 shows a color chart.</p>

<p>Red mixed with yellow will result in orange.</p>

<p>Red mixed with blue will result in purple.</p>

<p>Yellow mixed with blue will result in green.</p>

<p>The colors obtained by mixing any two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
primaries are called secondary colors. Therefor
the secondary colors are orange, purple and
green.</p>

<p>Orange mixed with purple will result in
brown.</p>

<p>Orange mixed with green will result in olive.</p>

<p>Purple mixed with green will result in slate.</p>

<p>The colors obtained by mixing any two
secondaries are called tertiary colors.</p>

<p>The tertiary colors are brown, olive and
slate.</p>

<p>Of course different tones of each color can
be made up by mixing unequal proportions.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Common Woods Used in Toy Making</span></h2>


<p><b>41. Economy in Selecting Material.</b>&mdash;Economic
use of materials should be encouraged at all times.
Toy making offers an excellent opportunity
where economy may be taught in the
most practical way.</p>

<p>Where toys are to be painted, more than one
kind of wood may be used in the same toy and
thereby using up small pieces of wood that
would otherwise be called scrap. Yet, it is not
advisable to sacrifice the strength and durability
of the whole toy for the sake of using up a
piece of scrap wood which weakens the particular
part of the toy where it is used. For that,
in the long run, is not economy.</p>

<p><b>42. Qualities of Different Woods Used.</b>&mdash;The
following are some of the common woods used
in toy making.</p>

<p>Maple: hard, fine grained, compact, tough,
used for wheels, axles, handles, dowel rods, etc.</p>

<p>Ash: white, strong, open grained, easily
worked; used for bodies of coasters, wheels,
axles, oars, etc.</p>

<p>Oak: hard, firm and compact, strong and
durable, hard to work.</p>

<p>Birch: moderately hard and heavy, even
grained; difficult to split, but easily worked.</p>

<p>Chestnut: resembles oak in appearance, is
much softer, moderately hard, course grained,
not strong, but durable.</p>

<p>Cypress: moderately hard, very fine and
close grained, virtually indestructable; known
as "the wood eternal".</p>

<p>Basswood: white, light, soft, tough, closed
grained, easily worked, not strong, but durable;
used for almost any part of a toy where much
strength is not required.</p>

<p>White Pine: very light, soft, close and
straight grained, inferior; easy to work.</p>

<p>Yellow Pine, yellowish, grain noticeable,
harder than white pine, stronger.</p>

<p>Tulip (yellow poplar): light, soft, close and
straight grained; tougher than many woods
equally soft, compact, not very strong or
durable, easily worked.</p>

<p>Spruce: straight growing, light, straight and
even in grain, tough, elastic, easy to work.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">Use of Jigs and Fixtures</span></h2>


<p><b>43. Value of Jigs and Fixtures.</b>&mdash;The use of
jigs, fixtures, and other labor-saving devices is
an important factor in illustrating industrial
and practical applications in the school shop.
It is advisable to let each group of boys work
out its own jig or fixture for the particular job
they have on hand.</p>

<p>The three most common forms of jigs are
cutting jigs, boring jigs, and assembling jigs.
The important reasons for the use of such
devices are: (1) They illustrate the speed of
output in shop work. (2) They give the
student a good idea of machine operation.
(3) They help in making the parts interchangeable.
(4) They offer an opportunity for getting
first hand information on cutting edge tools and
their proper uses. (5) They show the boy the
value of the use of jigs in factory work.</p>

<p>The toys illustrated in this book have many
simple operations, such as cutting stock to
length, drilling holes, surfacing, etc., that can
be easily done by the use of the proper fixtures.</p>

<p>For that reason toys are desirable projects to
be made by the productive plan. Fig. 18 shows
the use of a jig and the miter box.</p>

<p><b>44. Cutting Small Wheels.</b>&mdash;A circle of the desired
size wheel may be laid out on the wood
with the aid of a compass, and cut in the outline
with a coping saw or band saw. Of course,
it would take quite a long time by this method
to make the small wheels in large quantities and
besides the result would not be as good as when
the wheels are made by machine.</p>

<p><b>45. Turning Wheels.</b>&mdash;Another way to produce
wheels is to turn a cylinder to the required
diameter, on the turning lathe. Then cut the
cylinder on the circular saw into required
thicknesses of wheels desired. This method is
recommended for quick work.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>If it is desired to round the end of wheels the
operation can be done by leaving the cylinder
in the lathe and applying the broad side of the
skew chisel as shown in Fig. 33. The wheels
may then be polished with a cloth after they
have been sanded and while rotating in the lathe
as shown in Fig. 34. In sanding, use first a
fairly course grade of sandpaper, No. 1 or 1&frac12;
and afterwards a fine grade, No. O or OO.
Before applying the cloth the wood may be
varnished lightly while the lathe is not running,
taking care to wipe off all the surplus varnish.
The varnish will assist in giving the surface a
fine polish when the cloth is applied. For
further explanations of the use of the turning
lathe, see Sec. 55.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p><b>46. Use of Wheel Cutter.</b>&mdash;Still another method
of making small wheels is by use of the wheel
cutter as shown in Fig. 19. This wheel cutter
may be used in the ordinary bit brace. Good
results may be obtained where the wheels are
made out of thin, soft wood.</p>

<p>This wheel cutter is known on the market as
a leather washer cutter. If one cannot be
obtained it can easily be made in the school
machine shop at a small cost. Fig. 20 shows a
drawing of a wheel cutter.</p>

<p>You will notice that the blade can be adjusted
to cut any diameter desired.</p>

<p><b>47. Use of Coping Saw.</b>&mdash;Where a band saw is
not included in the shop equipment, many
articles such as animal forms and small wheels
could very easily be cut out with a coping saw.</p>

<p>A saw board, as shown in Fig. 21 should be
fastened to a table top with an iron clamp; or, a
saw board made to fasten in a vise may also be
used.</p>

<p>When cutting out the toy part, the coping saw
should be held in a vertical position as shown
in Fig. 22, and in an up-and-down motion,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
with short fast strokes, following the outline
carefully. Cut on the line. Do not press hard
on the saw for the blade is very thin and can very
easily be broken, but it should last a long time
if used correctly.</p>

</div>

<p><b>48. Cutting Sharp Corners.</b>&mdash;When cutting a
sharp turn in the wood with the coping saw,
care should be taken not to twist the saw blade
out of shape. Upon reaching the sharp turn,
continue the up-and-down motion, but without
doing any cutting; turn the wood very slowly
until you have made the complete turn, then
continue with the sawing and follow the rest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the outline carefully.</p>

<p><b>49. Removing the Saw-Blade from Frame.</b>&mdash;To
remove the saw-blade from the frame, place
the head of the frame against the table top as
shown in Fig. 23. Pressing down on the handle
will release the saw-blade. When inserting
the blade into the frame the same method may
be followed, being careful that the teeth of the
saw-blade point toward the handle of the frame.
The blade may be put in the end or the side
slots of the frame, using the side slots only
when the end slots will not serve the purpose.</p>

<p><b>50. Making Heavy Wheels.</b>&mdash;In turning heavier
wheels that are to be used for coasters,
kiddie cars, etc., the work is done with the
head stock only, the wood being supported by
the screw-center chuck or face plate.</p>

<p>In turning the wheel the first step is the
scraping cut as shown in Fig. 24. This cut is
properly made with the concave chisel held in
such a position as to give a light scraping cut.
Care should be exercised not to allow the chisel
to extend too deeply, otherwise the material
will chip with the grain.</p>

<p>After the desired circumference has been obtained
the surface should be worked to the
desired form as shown in Fig. 25. This is accomplished
by using the lathe rest, set at right
angles with the bed or parallel with the face
plate. The illustration in Fig. 26 shows the use
of the dividers in marking off the position of
the various corrugations in the wheel that is
being turned. The sanding should be done while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
the wheel is in the lathe. Use first a fairly
course grade of sand paper and afterwards a
fine grade, No. O or OO.</p>

<p><b>51. Designs for Wheels.</b>&mdash;Suggestions for
wooden toy wheels are shown in Fig. 27. Those
numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are plain wooden
wheels varying in design only. No. 8 and 9
are re-enforced with zinc and large iron washers.
No. 10 shows a segment of an iron pipe fitted in
the center of the wheel to prevent wearing
away of material. No. 11 shows a spoke wheel.
The spokes are made of dowel rods; these
fitting into a hub that can easily be turned out
on the lathe. No. 13 shows a wheel built in
segments which is then cut out on the band
saw to resemble a standard spoke wheel. The
rim is 1/8" steel, fastened to spokes with very
small rivets.</p>

</div>

<p><b>52. Cutting Wheels on Band-Saw.</b>&mdash;A circle of
the required size wheel may be marked off on
the wood with a compass, then cut in the outline
on the band-saw. This method will leave
square corners and will be more or less out of
truth with the center of the wheel. To true up
and smooth the outside of the wheel the lathe
attachment as shown in Fig. 28 can be easily
prepared. This attachment consists of a block <i>A</i>
fastened to the lathe bed with a single bolt,
and a stop <i>B</i> fastened to the upper face of the
block <i>A</i>. The carriage <i>C</i> is a loose piece the
same thickness as the stop <i>B</i> and is provided
with a dowel rod to fit the central hole in the
wheel. This dowel rod is so located that
when the edge of the carriage <i>C</i> is tight against
the edge of the stop <i>D</i>, the distance from the
center of the dowel rod to the face of the abra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>sive
material on the disk, will be equal to the
radius of the finished wheel.</p>

<p>The wood is cut out on the band saw a scant
1/16" over-size in diameter, and is then placed
on the dowel rod in the carriage <i>C</i> which is
held flat on block <i>A</i> while the edge of the
blank is brought in contact with the grinding
disc face by pushing the carriage forward with
the left hand while the blank is slowly revolved
with the right. This grinding is continued until
the edges of stop <i>B</i> and carriage <i>C</i> will remain
in contact during a complete revolution of the
wheel blank. During this grinding process, the
carriage should be moved back and forth from
the edge to the center of the grinding disc
so that the wear on the abrasive material may
be equalized.</p>

<p>Grinding discs may be made either of metal
or wood. Metal is preferable but a hardwood
disc fastened to a metal face plate will answer
very well. There are many methods of fastening
the abrasing material to the disc but the
most convenient way is by the use of stick belt
dressing. The disc is coated with dressing by
holding the stick against it as it revolves and
the abrasive is applied before the dressing has
set. A pair of dividers or trammels is used to
cut the abrasive material to the same diameter
as the disc and it should be warmed on the
uncoated side before it is applied. It sticks
tightly to the disc but is easily removed
and replaced with fresh material in a few
minutes.</p>

<p><b>53. Boring Holes in Wheels.</b>&mdash;The center holes
in wheels may be bored with bit and brace, but
better results are obtained if the holes are bored
in the lathe. A drill chuck fitted to the live
spindle and a drilling pad for the tail stock
spindle will be required to do this job efficiently.
The tail stock is locked fast and the wheel to be
drilled is placed against the drilling pad and
fed up to the revolving bit by turning the tail
spindle feed wheel. This method will produce
a cleaner hole and one that is square with the
wheel face.</p>

fair understanding of what is the correct
position to take at some of the principal
machines such as the lathe, universal saw,
jointer, and sander, is very important to the

engaged in toy making, where every knowledge
of use of machines, is put to the test.</p>

<p><b>55. Operating the Lathe.</b>&mdash;The lathe is perhaps
one of the most important machines used in
toy making. It lends itself to unlimited varieties
of work and for that reason is really indispensible
in the shop.</p>

<p>In Fig. 29 the student is preparing to take the
<i>roughing cut</i> in turning a cylinder. This
operation consists of removing the corners of
the square piece and is done with the tool known
as the <i>gouge</i>.</p>

<p>After the roughing cut has been taken, calipers
set to the diameter desired will determine
the depth of the next cut, <i>sizing cut</i>. The
illustration in Fig. 30 shows the student performing
this operation with the <i>cut-off tool</i>.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

<p>When the correct dimension has been found,
the next step in the process of turning a cylinder
is the <i>paring cut</i> or finishing cut, Fig. 31. This
is done with the <i>skew</i> or <i>bevel chisel</i>. A very thin
shaving is removed by this operation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>The ends are then cut by using the cut-off tool
as shown in Fig. 32. It is merely taking a
slice off the end. If a very thin slice is to be
removed, it is usually made by the long point of
the skew chisel. If it is more than a quarter of
an inch it should be <i>sized</i> and then removed
by the skew.</p>

<p>If it is desired to round the end of a piece or
to produce a convex surface the operation can
be done by applying the broad side of the skew
chisel, as in Fig. 33.</p>

<p><b>56. Face Plate Turning.</b>&mdash;The preceding paragraphs
describe the process of turning when
the piece is supported between the live and the
dead centers. The processes shown in Figs.
24, 25 and 26, illustrate the character of the
work done with the head stock only when the
piece is supported by the screw-center chuck
or face plate.</p>

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
